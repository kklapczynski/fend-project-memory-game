## Description

Project built from the starter project: some HTML and CSS styling to display a static version of the Memory Game project.
HTML, CSS were modified and app.js was practically all (beside provided shuffle function) coded for this assignment.

Goal of the game is to match all pairs of cards, which are shuffeled each time game is restarted.

## HowToPlay

Open index.html file in your browser. Turn two cards in each move by clicking it. Remember cards position to match all pairs, meaning turning the same cards in one move.

Moves are counted and time is measured for matching all pairs displayed after end of the game.
Rating starts with 5 stars and gets reduced by a star at 13, 16, 19 and 22 moves.

You can restart the game during one with button above the cards and after finishing the game when moves and time you took to finish is diplayed along with your rating.
